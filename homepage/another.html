                <h3>ðŸ“• My Story</h3>
                <p>I am transitioning careers from Architecture to <span>Computer Science/Programming. </span></p>
                <p>In 2020, I <span>started experimenting with no-code tools</span> and how they allowed me to create my own solutions with them. That was when I realized that programming was actually something I was falling in love with, only that I was doing it without writing code.</p>
                <p>In 2022, I started officially studying computer science, programming languages and software
                    creation concepts. It has been a wonderful journey up until now and one that I know is only
                    beginning. I always identified as a <span>creative, tech-savvy, curious and resourceful person.</span> So,
                     after getting to know more about the world of computer science, I knew that was something I
                     would be thrilled to learn.</p>
