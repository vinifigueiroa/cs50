Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: With 100 simulations, some numbers were not reflecting the ones returned were N was higher.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 1000 simulations could already give a clear view of the odds. However, 10000 would be best. more than that didn't make much difference.
